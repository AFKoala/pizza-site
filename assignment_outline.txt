Please make a pizza order app. I would  like to see check boxes and images for all of the ingredients (check boxes like we had in code review). 

Also address  if being delivered.  So that covers size, crust type, sauce, meats, veggies,  and delivery address.  

Please pass these back as separate arrays. We want to then pass these arrays into a confirmation view and show ingredients  and  image of 
ingredients. 

Now  using radio buttons allow me to select yes or no for each ingredient. Please separate all of the pizza parts .  

Finally pass all of the parts to a results page that shows  the final confirmed parts  along with images of my pizza parts. 

Please do this without the use of javascript. 

Please get a deployed link in the channel as soon as you get the app layout complete.
